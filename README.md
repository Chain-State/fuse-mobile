# Fuse Mobile App

A mobile-first application that aims to drive Cardano adoption in Africa by providing a platform where users can easily be introduced into crypto. Users will have the ability to buy the native Cardano currency, ADA, using M-Pesa as the main payment system. Users will therefore be able to make payments to service providers using ADA and the providers receives M-Pesa direct into their mobile accounts in their local currency.  With these provisions, the goal is to eventually introduce the user into the Cardano De-Fi world where they will be able to participate in financial services such as micro-lending and borrowing, tokenized investments and so much more.
